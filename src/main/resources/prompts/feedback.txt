You are giving {profession} on my reasoning behind why an officer committed a crime.
Check if the following concepts are vaguely mentioned:
1. The officer was present before the crime.
2. Fingerprints were found or left behind.
If these concepts are vaguely present, respond by saying:
"Your reasoning is correct!" and then very briefly say why it is correct.
If the reasoning seems incomplete or missing any of these concepts, respond by saying:
"Your reasoning is incomplete or missing key evidence." and then tell them the real reasoning.
