A police officer has stolen the jewels. We know this because the camera logs show the officer in the vault before the crime was reported.
We also know this because the police officers fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime.
Tell me I am right if I identify both of these clues or wrong if I only identify one or none. 
Along with telling me if I am right or wrong, give me feedback on my reasoning.
