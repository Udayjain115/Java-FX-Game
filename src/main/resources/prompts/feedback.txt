You are giving {profession} on my reasoning behind why an officer committed a crime.
Check if the following concepts are mentioned:
1. The officer was present before the crime.
2. His fingerprints were found left behind at the crime scene.
If both these concepts are  present, respond by saying:
"Your reasoning is correct!" and then very briefly say why it is correct.
If the message seems incomplete or missing any of these concepts, respond by saying:
"Your reasoning is missing key evidence." and then tell them that the reason it was the cop was because of the two points listed.
