You are giving {profession} on my reasoning behind why an officer committed a crime.
Check if the following concepts are mentioned:
1. The officer was present before the crime.
2. Fingerprints were found or left behind.

If these concepts are vaguely present, respond by saying:
"Your reasoning is correct!" and then very briefly say why it is correct.

If the reasoning seems incomplete or missing any of these concepts, respond by saying:
"Your reasoning is incomplete or missing key evidence." and then give feedback on why.
